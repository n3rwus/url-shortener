A simple, fast, and secure URL shortener built with FastAPI. Transform long URLs into short, manageable links with analytics and intelligent security features.

## üéØ Motivation

In today's digital world, sharing long URLs can be cumbersome and unprofessional. This project was born out of the need for a lightweight, self-hosted URL shortening service that prioritizes:

- **Privacy**: Your data stays under your control with self-hosted deployment
- **Security**: Real-time protection against malicious domains using trusted blacklists
- **Performance**: FastAPI's async capabilities ensure lightning-fast redirects
- **Simplicity**: Clean, minimalist API design focused on core functionality
- **Learning**: A practical project to explore modern Python web development with FastAPI
- **Production-Ready**: Docker deployment with secrets management and health monitoring

## üìã Description

This URL shortener provides a modern REST API built with FastAPI that allows users to:

- **Shorten URLs**: Convert long URLs into short, shareable links with automatic collision handling
- **Security First**: Automatic malicious domain detection using CERT Poland's blacklist
- **Smart Caching**: In-memory caching for fast redirects and reduced database load
- **Analytics**: Track click counts and basic usage statistics
- **Expiration Control**: Set automatic expiration dates for links
- **Production Ready**: Docker deployment with PostgreSQL database support

### Key Features

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- PostgreSQL database
- Docker (optional, recommended for production)

### Local Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/n3rwus/url-shortener.git
cd url-shortener

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables (copy .env.test for development)
cp .env.test .env

# Configure your database settings in .env:
# USER=your_db_user
# PASSWORD=your_db_password
# HOST=localhost
# PORT=5432
# DBNAME=url_shortener

# Run the application
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

### Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build

# Or build the Docker image manually
docker build -t url-shortener .
docker run -p 8000:8000 url-shortener
```

### API Documentation

Once running, visit:
- **Interactive API Docs**: `http://localhost:8000/docs` (Swagger UI)
- **Alternative Docs**: `http://localhost:8000/redoc` (ReDoc)
- **Health Check**: `http://localhost:8000/v1/health`

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Shorten a URL
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/urls" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"original_url": "https://example.com/very/long/url"}'

# Access shortened URL (replace {short_code} with actual code)
curl -L "http://localhost:8000/{short_code}"
```

## üîí Security Features

This application implements several security measures to protect against malicious URLs and abuse:

### Domain Blacklist Integration
- **Real-time Validation**: Integration with CERT Poland's malicious domain blacklist
- **Automatic Updates**: Fetches the latest blacklist on each request with local backup
- **Graceful Fallback**: Uses cached local backup if remote service is unavailable

### Input Validation
- **URL Scheme Validation**: Only accepts `http` and `https` URLs
- **Domain Extraction**: Validates domains against known malicious sources
- **Request Validation**: Pydantic models ensure data integrity

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Service continues with local blacklist if remote fails
- **Detailed Logging**: Security events are logged for monitoring
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages for rejected URLs

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

```
app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/           # Configuration, logging, caching
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/         # SQLAlchemy database models
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ schemas/        # Pydantic request/response models
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ repositories/   # Data access layer
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ service/        # Business logic layer
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ routes/         # API endpoint definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ db/            # Database connection and session management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ integration/   # External service integrations (blacklist)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/         # Utility functions
```

### Design Patterns
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean separation between business logic and data access
- **Dependency Injection**: FastAPI's dependency system for testable code
- **Service Layer**: Business logic encapsulation with clear interfaces
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-based configuration with secrets support
